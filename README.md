# EXPERIMENT-3 | Dwayne Pendilla | 2ECE-C
## ****************** Experiment Overview 🔍 ****************** 
Experiment 3 focuses on the application of the Pands Library. This experiment aims to identify and apply different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas Library.

### This experiment is comprised of 2 problems:
(1) PROBLEM 1 - where I used the file "cars.csv" and uploaded its data into a data frame using pandas, and got the first and last 5 rows.

(2) PROBLEM 2 - where I used the same data fram from problem 1 (cars) and performed the operations subsetting, slicing, and indexing

## ********************* Coding Process ✏️ *********************
 *For Problem 1,*

-- > First, I uploaded the data of the "cars.csv" file into the data frame "cars"

-- > I then got the first and last 5 rows of the data frame using the functions "cars.head()" and "cars.tail()"

-- > The final step is to normalize the ndarray by using the formula = x - Mean / Standard Deviation. Coding-wise, that will be [(x-y)/z] and that will be stored as "normx".

*For Problem 2: Divisible by 3 Problem,*

-- > The first step was to create the 10x10 ndarray with elements as the quares of the first 100 positive integers.

--> Next, elements inside the ndarray are then determined whether they are divisible by 3 or not. Those divisible by 3 are then saved into another ndarray.

## ********************* Conclusion 🤓 *********************

*After conducting this experiment, I learned to:*

(a.) to identify and apply different codes and functions

(b.) to be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a
Numpy library.
