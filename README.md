# EXPERIMENT-3 | Dwayne Pendilla | 2ECE-C
## ****************** Experiment Overview 🔍 ****************** 
Experiment 3 focuses on the application of the Pands Library. This experiment aims to identify and apply different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas Library.

### This experiment is comprised of 2 problems:
(1) NORMALIZATION PROBLEM - where a 5x5 ndarray with random elements is stored to variable X, and this ndarray is normalized.

(2) DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM - where the SQUARES of the first 100 positive integers are the elements of a 10x10 ndarray, and from this ndarray, all elements divisible by 3 are saved.

## ********************* Coding Process ✏️ *********************
 *For Problem 1: Normalization Problem,*

-- > The "np.random.random((x,y))" function is used and stored to variable x to generate the 5x5 random element ndarray.

-- > Once the ndarray is generated and stored to "x", the next step is to get the MEAN and STANARD DEVIATION of the ndarray. That can be done by using the "x.mean()" and "x.std()" functions, which are then stored to y and z, respectively.

-- > The final step is to normalize the ndarray by using the formula = x - Mean / Standard Deviation. Coding-wise, that will be [(x-y)/z] and that will be stored as "normx".

*For Problem 2: Divisible by 3 Problem,*

-- > The first step was to create the 10x10 ndarray with elements as the quares of the first 100 positive integers.

--> Next, elements inside the ndarray are then determined whether they are divisible by 3 or not. Those divisible by 3 are then saved into another ndarray.

## ********************* Conclusion 🤓 *********************

*After conducting this experiment, I learned to:*

(a.) to identify and apply different codes and functions

(b.) to be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a
Numpy library.
